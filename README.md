The Adversarial Observation framework is a novel solution that addresses concerns regarding the fairness and social impact of machine learning models, specifically neural networks. The framework provides a user-friendly approach to adversarial testing and explainability, utilizing an adversarial swarm optimizer to increase the ease of explainability for the network. It comprises two intertwined parts focusing on adversarial testing and explainability, utilizing the fast gradient sign method (FGSM) and the Adversarial Particle Swarm Optimization (APSO) algorithm to identify regions where the network is most susceptible to adversarial attacks. The framework has the potential to significantly improve the social impact of neural network models, enhancing their effectiveness and efficiency while improving transparency and trust between stakeholders.


# Features
---
