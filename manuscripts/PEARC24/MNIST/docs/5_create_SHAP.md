# SHAP Values Generation and Visualization Description

The provided code is a Python script that generates and saves SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values for a given model and dataset. It visualizes the original images, along with their corresponding SHAP values, and saves the results.

## Functions

### `getData(dataloader)`
This function retrieves one sample of each class from the given dataloader. It iterates over the dataloader and collects unique samples based on their target labels. The data and target tensors are sorted based on the target labels. The data tensor is stacked along the 0th dimension, and the target tensor is converted to a torch tensor. The function returns the data and target tensors.

### `save_and_plot_shap_values(dataloader, model)`
This function generates and saves the SHAP values for the given model and dataloader. It first checks the availability of a GPU device and clears the GPU memory. It retrieves the data and target tensors using the `getData` function. The tensors are moved to the GPU if available. The model is also moved to the GPU. A `shap.DeepExplainer` object is created with the model and data tensors. SHAP values are generated using the explainer. 

The function creates a directory named 'SHAP' to store the results. It then creates a figure with a 10x11 grid of subplots. The function iterates over the data samples and their corresponding SHAP values. For each sample, the original image is saved as a numpy array. The original image and its label are plotted in the first column of the subplot grid. The SHAP values are plotted in the subsequent columns, up to a maximum of 10 values. Each SHAP value is saved as a numpy array. The function also creates individual row figures to remove empty cells and white space. These row figures are saved separately.

Empty rows in the subplot grid are removed. A colorbar is added to the figure. The final figure, row figures, and colorbar are saved. The figures and subplots are closed to free up resources.

### `main()`
This function is the main entry point of the script. It loads the MNIST dataset using `load_MNIST_data` function and builds the MNIST model using `build_MNIST_Model`. The pre-trained model weights are loaded from the 'MNIST_cnn.pt' file. The `save_and_plot_shap_values` function is called with the test dataloader and the loaded model.

## Execution
The script starts by importing the required libraries and modules. Then, it defines the `getData`, `save_and_plot_shap_values`, and `main` functions. Finally, the `main` function is called to execute the script.
